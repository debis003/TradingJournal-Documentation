# TradingJournal
**A student-built trading journal — clean, fast, and actually affordable.**

> I couldn't justify $30/month for a trading journal as a student, so I spent nights & weekends building my own. Frontend is largely done; backend comes next. Feedback welcome.

---

## Why this exists
I started trading during university and found that pricey journals and clunky spreadsheets slowed me down. Over ~3 years I learned by building, at times with help from AI coding/design assistants for scaffolding, refactors, and iteration. The goal: **a focused journal that helps you improve without blowing profits on tooling**.  
*Note: the product itself does not include AI features (yet).*

## Highlights
- **Dashboard at a glance** — balance, win rate, largest win/loss, **P&L distribution**, **cumulative P&L**, streaks, and a trading calendar.
- **Reports suite** — Overall Summary; **Performance** curves; **Analytics** (drawdown, streaks, EV); **Evaluation** (risk-multiple histogram + insights); **Trade Log** (search, filters, **CSV export**); **Trade Statistics**; **Monthly Report** (equity vs volume).
- **Entry flow** — Quick *Simple* mode or a *Detailed* 4-step wizard (market → result → entries/TP/SL → notes).
- **Notes workspace** — daily journal, session recap, goals, trading plans; paste images/screenshots directly.
- **Privacy** — local-first by default; data export built-in.
- **Themes** — Light, Dark, and ✨ **Galaxy**.

## Design & Principles
- **Essentials first** — only the metrics and flows that change behavior.
- **Low friction** — quick logging + powerful review.
- **Your data, your rules** — local-first with explicit export; any future cloud sync will be opt-in.
- **Accessible pricing** — students and small accounts shouldn't pay enterprise prices.

---

## Roadmap
**Next up**
- Backend + auth/sessions  
- Enhanced trade data model (sessions/tags) + improved import  
- Analytics v1 (equity curve, drawdown, expectancy, R:R buckets)  
- Review mode (filters, “mistake taxonomy”), export/backup

**Nice-to-have**
- Mobile quick-log  
- Journal prompts & review templates  
- Multi-account/assets  
- Public API for programmatic logging

## FAQ

**Does this app use AI?**  
Not yet. I used AI coding/design assistants during development, but the product itself currently has **no AI features**.

**So how was AI used?**  
As a pair-programmer/design helper: generating component scaffolds, refactors, copy tweaks, and UI ideas. All features were implemented and reviewed by me.

**Can I import/export my data?**  
Yes — **import** Excel (.xlsx) and CSV; **export** to Excel (.xlsx) or CSV from the app.

**How is my data handled?**  
Currently, all data is stored locally on your device (no servers, no external sync). You can export your data anytime as backup. If the project proves successful, I plan to offer an **optional** cloud sync. It would be off by default and include export/delete controls.

**Is there a backend?**  
Not yet. The current version is local-first (all data stays on your device). The next major milestone is adding **optional backend + user accounts** for those who want cloud sync and multi-device access.

**Can I try it right now?**  
A public demo/video walkthrough is coming. If you'd like early access, reach out on LinkedIn or email (below).

**Will this be open source?**  
No — this project is not open source.

**What's the pricing going to be?**  
TBD. The goal is student-friendly and meaningfully cheaper than $30/month tools.

**Who is this for?**  
Individual traders who want a clean, fast journal with the essentials, no bloat and a review workflow that actually improves decision-making.

**What browsers/devices are supported?**  
Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Mobile-responsive design; a dedicated mobile app is a future consideration.

**Planned AI features:**  
To be announced.
